# 🎬 Prompts for "The Last Signal"

## 🌍 Shared World Prompt

> The world is a near-future post-collapse Earth. Civilization has gone quiet. Nature is slowly reclaiming the ruins — highways are cracked, buildings are empty, and remnants of technology still flicker faintly. The air is calm and heavy with memory. One lone traveler in a dark jacket moves quietly through these forgotten spaces, guided by a mysterious beam of light that pierces the clouds from the distant mountains. The visual style is cinematic, moody, and grounded in realism, with soft twilight lighting and earthy, muted tones.

## ▶️ Scene 1: The Signal in the Sky

**scene1/scenario.mp4**

> [Shared World] Show the traveler standing at a lonely crossroads just after sunset. The camera pans to a glowing vertical light beaming from a mountain far away. The signpost is crooked, unreadable. The air hums faintly. A sense of mystery looms.

**scene1/result_choice1.mp4**

> [Shared World] Show the traveler packing a small bag in a dim apartment, then stepping onto a rural road before dawn. The road is overgrown. They walk toward the horizon, silhouetted by the first light of day.

**scene1/result_choice2.mp4**

> [Shared World] The traveler sits on a rooftop surrounded by antennas and moss. They scan the horizon with binoculars, fixating on the distant light. Trees sway gently below them as dusk deepens.

## ▶️ Scene 2: Crossing the Wastes

**scene2/scenario.mp4**

> [Shared World] The traveler walks along a broken highway. Grass sprouts through cracks in the concrete. Cars rust in place. The camera follows as a faint electronic humming builds in the background.

**scene2/result_choice1.mp4**

> [Shared World] Inside a dusty, abandoned gas station, the traveler discovers an emergency radio. It flickers and emits a short coded signal. Shadows stretch across broken shelves.

**scene2/result_choice2.mp4**

## ▶️ Scene 3: Patterns and Paranoia

**scene3/scenario.mp4**

> [Shared World] From a rooftop, the traveler watches the mountain beam pulse. In response, a rhythmic flicker of light emerges from a nearby hill. The skyline is quiet, silhouetted against a deep violet sky.

**scene3/result_choice1.mp4**

> [Shared World] Climbing a nearby hill under stars, the traveler finds a worn backpack and a journal half-buried in dry leaves. The final page trails off mid-sentence. The wind picks up.

**scene3/result_choice2.mp4**

> [Shared World] The traveler uses a mirror to signal back. The pulsing mountain beam shifts slightly — and begins to point directly toward them. Their face tightens in uncertainty.

## ▶️ Scene 4: The Threshold

**scene4/scenario.mp4**

> [Shared World] The traveler reaches a vast, empty clearing. The mountain beam expands into a doorway of light hovering above the ground. The sound is low and resonant. Dust floats in the air. Everything is still.

**scene4/result_choice1.mp4**

> [Shared World] The traveler walks into the doorway. A soft glow surrounds them, and their silhouette fades into pure white. The scene quiets into a glowing, ethereal haze.

**scene4/result_choice2.mp4**

> [Shared World] The traveler hesitates, then steps back. The light vanishes. The world returns to silence. The traveler looks up at the empty sky, visibly changed — solemn, yet calm.
